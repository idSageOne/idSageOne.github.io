	<h1>Pin's Journal</h1>
	<h2>2012, blog branding</h2>
	<p>
	<b>Pin's Journal</b> was my personal blog that touched upon gaming and game development, as well as some random thoughts on the comfort of workflow and what not. Since anything personal allows for various degrees of customization, I decided to stylize it a little. Branding had to be simplistic, but quirky, so I decided to go with black and white theme with blue-highlights. Not much to explain, but I still enjoy the results today, since it seems like a modern design.

	<h1>Personal avatars</h1>
	<h2>2012-2014, graphic design</h2>
	<p>
	After customizing the blog, I liked the idea of a frog being my personal mascot. A spirit animal, if you will. So the frog became a recurring theme in many other works. And how could I not put this cute little thing on my avatars.

	<h1>Custom wallpapers</h1>
	<h2>2012-2013, graphic design</h2>
	<p>
	People love aesthetically pleasing things. And since looking at backgrounds and wallpapers makes at least 50% of our lives, I figured, why not make some custom wallpapers as well.
	</p>
	<p>
	The first one was created in 2012 for the New Year wallpaper contest hosted by <b>XGM Community</b>. It actually managed to <a target = "_blank" href = "http://xgm.guru/p/xgm-team/ny2013-wallpapers-contest-final">get third place</a> among 11 other contenders. The choices were made for the following reasons: colors are close to the traditional western Christmas, the stripes and the whole image resemble a gift package, but the middle part was supposed to have a stern look (like the XGM Community logo design at that time).

		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="clearfix"></div>
	
	<p>
	The second one was a personal side-project. Unfortunately, I can't recall the ideas behind this wallpaper. It was probably an experiment with textures or an attempt at simplistic design with nice colors. I think it worked.
