	<h1>Playlist Overhaul</h1>
	<h2>2012-2017, album cover design</h2>
	<p>
	In 2012 I faced a problem with my music playlist becoming cluttered and almost impossible to search something in. Thus an idea for a big playlist overhaul was born. I wanted to focus on aesthetics of the album gallery and ease of use and search. So the work branched out into improving overall playlist structure with the use of tags and making the album-covers look standardized, instead of a complete mish-mash.
	</p>
	<p>
	Both tasks were fairly simple, but required some time to complete. The tag structure was changed for the offline library on my PC and smartphone using the following scheme: <b>Author - Title (featuring) [Remix]</b>.
	<p>
	The graphic part of the task required a bit more work, but it was following these guidelines:
	<ul>
		<li>Every genre in the playlist should have a custom background.</li>
		<li>Every genre should have a color, associated with it. This color is used to highlight letters in the artist’s name and the song title.</li>
		<li>First letter of an artist’s name, song title and remixer’s name should be highlighted.</li>
		<li>Keywords, such as <b>Remix</b>, should be highlighted.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
	Also since the software allowed ratings, I decided to add a rating indicator to the cover art. Artists with more than one track in my library, who had 5 stars on every song, received a frog on the cover art. If an author had only 5- and 4-star songs in the library, his cover-art got a semitransparent frog. Artists, who had only one track or songs with a rating lower than 4 stars, didn’t receive the indicator on their cover-art.
	</p>

	<h2>2013 - Simplified and using geometry</h2>
	<p>
	At some point the rating system got too complicated with unnecessary nuances and making covers for new songs has become a 5-10 minute drag. Therefore in 2013 the cover-art had to be reworked.

	<p>
	The new version, besides having a different layout, displayed 3 things: artist, genre and rating. The genre was expressed through color and the image used. The rating system was simplified and instead of and artist-rating depicted a single track rating. Also the frog had to be replaced with a simple star due to the new more geometric look.
	</p>

	<h2>2014 - Adding backgrounds and mixing up</h2>
	<p>
	Finally by 2014 the idea of ratings has become detrimental, because if I didn’t really like the song, why would it be in the playlist at all? The layout remains almost unchanged, apart from displaying genres and sub-genres, which reduced the number of required covers per artist.

	<h2>2016 - Pixelated and desaturated</h2>
	<p>
	2016 was largely a year of experiments for me. The overall geometric idea was thrown out of the window to make path for pixels and blur-filters. Not all of these ideas even looked good in the final gallery, so the changes were short-lived. And by the beginning of 2017 a new design has come to fruition.

	<h2>2017 - Minimalistic and color-corrected</h2>
	<p>
	If the experiments of 2016 have left anything useful that’s certainly work with color and photography. Desaturation and slight overexposure are the current trend in the cover-art for my playlist these days. The content has also been put on the chopping block, leaving only the background, the bare-minimum geometry and a genre in the middle.
	</p>
	<p>
	This minimalism in everything allows easy multi-genre tag editing as well as saves disk space, since there is only one cover for a genre. Overall it is a blast working on these customization projects and it is useful to see the change of style in retrospective. In conclusion, I can’t wait until the next time I get to do a similar project!
